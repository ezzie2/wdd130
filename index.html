        Hello. My name is Esmeralda Stevens. I feel both <em>excited</em> and <em>nervous</em> for this class.
        I don't have any experience with coding, but I'm wanting to dive into it. I have
        a Bachelor's in Psychology, which has allowed me to work with junior high students. I'm
        a behavior internventionist. However, I'm ready to take on the <strong>challenge of learning how to code.</strong>
    </p>
