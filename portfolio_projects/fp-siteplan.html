            <h1>Site Purpose</h1>
            <p>
                As a parent, what is your biggest worry? Your kids!!!!!!! If your kids
                have Autism, ADHD, Depression or Anxiety you may find yourself not
                knowing what to do or where to turn for help. These are the most
                common mental disorders kids face today. Although not new, many still
                struggle to understand the best way to help those who have it. Our
                website will not only guide you to where you can get help, but also
                provide you with more resources. We will provide you
                with guides to practice at home and that can help students at school.
                We will provide you with ways to help them see their challenge as a
                strength and not a weakness. In addition, we provide you a way for you
                to track the work done by anyone who is helping your son/daughter.

            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>
                This is geared towards anyone who has a child with mental illnesses.
                It could be a parent, legal guardian, social workers, foster parents,

            <h1>Site Map and Content</h1>
            <p>Why visit our site? This will be included with a mission statement. This goes in hand with the site purpose, but will
                be stated in a simpler form. There are so many topics we could focus on, but to not overwhelm the parent, we will 
                only focus on three common mental disabilities: Anxiety, Depression and ADHD. Other sites have a broad overview of mental disabilities,
                which can be daunting. By focusing on these specific disorders, we will narrow down the time anyone has to be online to find resources.
                We will briefly describe the disorders.We will create different sections for each age group: child, teenager and adult. We may an optional 
                survery the user can take to provide him an email with resources according to his/her results. <br> We will also include an immediate help 
                action box to immediately provide help to anyone. If this page gets further work, this button will have a hover button leading the user to 
                a page that has phone numbers to connect them with someone to offer assistance or if there is time it would nice to include this page. 
                This is like a 24/7 help line. This will provide a quick glimpse into what our focus is for the website.
