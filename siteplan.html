        three major states: Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. Our season
        begins late spring and ends early fall. If this is your first time,
        our customer service will connect you with certified guides who can
        guide you into choosing the best experience package for you. Even if
        it is not your first time, we still connect you with a certified guide
        to help you book the experience of a lifetime.

      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We provide rafting tours for all skills level. We offer tours for in
        shape individuals, outdoorsy types, families, work groups, groups,
        buddies, etc. Our early season begins late spring until late fall.
        During our early season, we provide high-quality wet suits. The
        weather is cooler, but group sizes are smaller and there are lots of
        animals to see. If you are an adrenaline seeker, the snowmelt from the
        mountains create the best rapids one can imagine. The summer provides
        the perfect temperatures for you to not be afraid to take a dip. One
        can also enjoy scenic floats and enjoy watching local wildlife. Fall
        will not dissapoint you. Witness mother nature's change of seasons
        surrounded by golden foliage. <br />Things to consider before booking
        with us is that you must be at least 12 years old. A parent or legal
        guardian must accompany anyone under the age of 17. Liability forms
        must be signed ahead of time. Once booked, you will receive an itenary
        with information such as guide's name, where to meet, transportation,
        rentals(wet suits), group size, etc.<br />
